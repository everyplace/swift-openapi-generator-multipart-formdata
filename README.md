# swift-openapi-genenerator-multipart-formdata
## An example of using POST endpoints with multipart/form-data

The primary purpose of this project is to illustrate how to properly create multipart/form-data POST requests with an api client, as generated from an openapi document using the `swift-openapi-generator` library. This project isn't necessarily useful inandof itself, but it should serve as a helpful starter to building client libraries that can POST efficiently.

This project is currently configured to use a sample glitch backend:
- Running project: `https://swift-openapi-generator-multipart-formdata.glitch.me`
- Server code: `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/swift-openapi-generator-multipart-formdata`

To run:
`swift run MultipartCli --image "path/to/image" --description "File description"`

There is an optional additional parameter `--endpoint`, which allows the setting of an arbitrary endpoint. This is useful for testing against localhost or another backend besides the above sample glitch.com host.
